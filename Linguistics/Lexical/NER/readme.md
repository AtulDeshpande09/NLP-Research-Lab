# ðŸ§  Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) using CRF

This is a minimal yet complete implementation of a custom **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** model using **Conditional Random Fields (CRF)**. Designed from scratch for educational and research purposes, the system is trained on a **small, manually annotated dataset**, demonstrating the foundational logic behind sequence labeling in NLP.
